# Phase1_assessment
A prototyped application which does various file operations.
As this is a prototyped application, the user interaction will be via a command line and actual file
handling is not applied here. We are taking file as user input in the form of strings and doing 
various operations like add, delete, search, sort, display etc, using some data structures.
